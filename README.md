## History
Centicrawler was originally designed as a class assignment by Jackson Miller. It was intended to be a clone of Centipede. It used
the original sprite sheet from the 1981 arcade game. Only a minimal set of features were implemented to meet the grading rubric.

The sprites have been replaced with new graphics. Some elements from Centipede are still missing.

Centicrawler is adding new elements like a 2 player simultaneous mode.
